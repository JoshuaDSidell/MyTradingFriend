Application:
MyTradingFriend is meant to fill the void new traders encounter as they utilize strategies to maximize their returns / dividends

Use Case:
This application uses market data and machine learning to show potential yields of multiple investing strategies such as

Dollar Cost Averaging
Investing large sums money at one or during dips
Micro transactions
and more

Why:
Modern tools and websites catering to new traders are abundant, however, these tools may/are daunting to new users as the majority are too used to simple, easy to use, applications/tools.

MyTradingFriend seeks to act as a solution, and by extension, a tool to be used standalone or in addition to modern toolsets
